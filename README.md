# railwayReservation
The Railway Reservation System API, built using Express.js and MongoDB, provides comprehensive functionality for managing trains, passengers, schedules, and seat reservations. It allows the addition of new trains and schedules, captures passenger details, and manages seat availability for each train schedule. The API supports reservation functionality, automatically closing reservations a specified time before departure (e.g., 3 hours prior). It efficiently handles reservation statuses, including waiting lists, confirmed reservations with seat assignments, and unconfirmed cases. Additionally, a scheduler automates reservation closure and other time-based tasks, ensuring smooth operations within the system
